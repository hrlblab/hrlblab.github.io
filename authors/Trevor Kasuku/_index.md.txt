I'm currently a senior undergrad student studying Computer Science at Vanderbilt University, supervised by Prof. Yuankai Huo. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and software development.
I have learned a lot about artificial intelligence and machine learning on my own. I also worked as a machine learning engineer intern at Bank of America in the summer of 2023.

My current research direction is the use of deep learning to solve medical problems. Outside of research, I love learning new languages and photography.
