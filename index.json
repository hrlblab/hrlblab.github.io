[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"This thesis addresses the challenges of efficient representation learning across three crucial categories of optical images: microscopic, pathology, and meta-optic images. Microscopic images, characterized by dense dynamic objects, often suffer from resource-intensive object annotations. To tackle this, we introduce a novel deep learning-based unsupervised sub-cellular microvilli segmentation method and propose an annotation-free video analysis paradigm. In the realm of medical optical images, we propose the SimTriplet approach, integrating GPU memory-efficient techniques with self-supervised learning to enhance computational efficiency and feature extraction. Moreover, we tackle the escalating computational demands by introducing a large convolution kernel design for LMNN models, reducing computational latency and energy consumption. We validate our approach through physical meta-material fabrication.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"afa2a3350eaa87a4d747aa6ea833998c","permalink":"https://hrlblab.github.io/author/2024-05-quan-liu/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/author/2024-05-quan-liu/","section":"authors","summary":"This thesis addresses the challenges of efficient representation learning across three crucial categories of optical images: microscopic, pathology, and meta-optic images.
